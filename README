What's This?
==============

This is a drop-in implementation of the org.JSON library that is optimized to reduce memory comsumption on JSONObject instances that have many keys.

At first, the purpose was to optimize it for memory, but I have also noticed that the processing was optimized as well.

From very basic testing I have noticed that the memory comsumption, on a 362kb JsonArray of JSONObjects, have reduced by 25% 
and the processing has improved by 7%.  

The only thing changed from the original org.json implementation is the caching of the JSONObject keys. Instead of duplicating them on every 
object. It's very optimized for handling objects like this: 
[{"id": 123, "value": "value 1"}, {"id": 321, "value": "value 2"}] 

I have tried to keep the same structure of the org.JSON library, so it means that you can execute this command in your project and it will work:

$ find ./src/ | grep java  | grep -v .svn | xargs perl -pi -e 's/org.json/com.mufumbo.json/g'

Why?!
--------------

When I wrote my first android application it felt like a good idea to work with the JSON objects directly and never actually transforming 
them into translated Java model objects.

At that time the android phones were very slow and the advantage was clear:
- Faster to write the code. (No need to create code for transforming JSONObjects into an Java object)
- Faster to process. (No memory allocation of model objects and later GC of the JSONObjects)
- No need to write code to serialize the objects and pass them between activities. (Just make startActivity(new Intent(this, myJsonObject.toString()) and you're done)

The disadvantages are clear: 
- Spaghetti code with no clear models. 
- Waste of memory due to JSONObject way of handling the data.

Not everybody can do this and it has some restrictions. For example, the server needs to only send the actual json that is going to be used, 
otherwise that memory will be hanging in the phones. 

If I knew that my application was going to be successful, I would probably not go with this path. 
Although now it's too late to rewrite all this stuff, so this optimizaiton as really necessary.

Why use this?
--------------

After two years the android phones are fast and this type of optimization doesn't make sense anymore. 
The problem is that I still have a couple of millions of users with old phones. 

The most difficult part is that my app now look like android 4.3 interface, but I still have users on 1.6. The problem there is that it means
that memory management is going to explode at some time. Due to beaultiful graphics and other things that you will want to put on your app.

In my case I have noticed that the JSON objects were consuming way too much memory, so I had to optimize it.  


How to test this?
--------------

For the "benchmarks" I have done a super simple JSONTest.java file that has a JUnit test. To run it, remember to add this to the eclipse VM arguments:

--javaagent:~/YOURworkspace/mufumbo-json/lib/classmexer.jar

This still needs to be validated. The results, in my computer, are:

*Processing str[362299] --- GAIN[594kb] --- nonoptimized[20] memory is [16][2347kb] and optimized[14] is [24][1753kb]*
