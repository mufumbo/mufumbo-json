Put all the chicken pieces back in the pan, along with the chiles and garlic and add the beer. A great head of steam will rise up the the most wonderful aroma. Quickly now, clamp on the lid and turn the heat to low.  Check every 5 minutes and turn the chicken in the reducing broth.  Cook for about 15 to 18 minutes. If the broth cooks away toward the end of the cooking, just add a tablespoon more beer.  At the end you should be left with a nice thick glaze.  Push the chicken around the beer glaze so it all gets coated. This is about the best taco meat you will ever encounter.

since another reviewer said it was good over noodles, so I boiled pasta and once almost cooked I put it in the bottom of a casserole dish...then topped with the sauce (to which I added some extra spices since it was a tiny bit bland) then the cracker / poppyseed mix...then baked the whole thing together for 30-40min. it turned out great!! before this I only thought of poppyseeds as dessert things....I\u0027ve definitely changed my mind!! thanks for the great recipe!","rating":4.0,"created":"2012-11-30T02:05:22Z","username":"dolphinchick","userInfo":{"snapshotUrl":"http://lh6.ggpht.com/siR8htENozbrSJ6TW26grCBKcx9uPs5Iyjb0Et5qDp0ZKmcOBs7JLwwbc_rYrP2HHGzxnOun6GuwGGwsbDY"}},{"comment":"this has been one of my most favorite recipes. it\u0027s easy to make and it is a simple crowd pleaser.","rating":5.0,"created":"2012-11-27T15:34:18Z","username":"tiffanyA"},{"comment":"doubled the recipe...it was wonderful over noodles and over rice!
